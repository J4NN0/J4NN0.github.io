      Swimming has been a big part of my life since I was a child. Below are the key highlights and most important milestones from each year of my journey.
    </p>

    <p class="year-tag">1999 - 2009</p>
    <p>
     I've been swimming since I was 4 years old. A few years later, I began racing in amateur competitions, and at 13 I started swimming competitively.

      I claimed the regional championship once again, and from that season onward I never lost the open regional title in the 100m and 200m breaststroke. I also competed at national level, reaching the finals at the Italian Championships.

I also raced at the Summer Italian Championships in Rome, qualifying with the second-best time in the 200m breaststroke and finishing in the top 10 after reaching the finals in both the 100m and 200m breaststroke.

      In my final year of high school, before earning my diploma and beginning my engineering studies, I won the open regional championship in 100m and 200m breaststroke and competed at the Italian level, reaching the finals.

      This was my last season before retiring from competitive swimming to focus on my studies. I still participated in some national competitions and in a few high-level events against elite swimmers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Lochte" target="_blank">Ryan Lochte</a>.
