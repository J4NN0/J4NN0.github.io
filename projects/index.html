      <h1><a href="https://github.com/ETS-PoliTO" target="_blank">ESP32 Tracking System (ETS)</a></h1>
      <p>
        A system made up of ESP32 devices and from a server that acts as a collector of the information collected and allows its processing and display.
      </p>
      <p>
        The firmware of the ESP is written with the purpose to sniff probe request packets sent by smartphones that are looking for a Wi-Fi connection. From each sniffed packet some information are extracted and, after each minute, they are sent to a server that process and store them in a SQL database. 
      </p>
      <p>
        TIt is possible to see the processed information, like the real time location of the smartphones, smartphone frequency and etc., through a GUI.
      </p>
      <p>
        This <a href="https://youtu.be/NMywky9Ts_w" target="_blank">demo</a> shows how ESP32 works.

      <p>
        State-of-the-art research in order to study and design data models for Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) architectures - associated with <a href="http://netgroup.polito.it" target="_blank">PoliTO Netgroup</a> (Computer Networks Group at Politecnico di Torino).
      </p>
      <p>
        Proposed a new data format (described by means of an XML schema) for the representation of all the most relevant information in the NFV (Network Function Virtualization) and SDN (Software Defined Networking). Also a RESTful web service has been implemented in order to store and retrieve the NFV/SDN information.

        <b>1. </b>It is showed what happens if different Principal Components (PC) are chosen as basis for images representation and classification. Then, the Naive Bayes Classifier has been chosen and applied in order to classify the image.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. </b>Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.

        Prepare your wedding at best by sitting your guests in the best possible way (based on their relationships and/or interactions).
      </p>
      <p>
        The wedding has a set of guests, a number of tables, and, for each table, the maximum number of seats. Each guest has an interaction with the other guests (a unit value from a minimum of -5 to a maximum of +5). The algorithm, through a recursive function, will calculate the average mood of the room and will give you each person's seating.
